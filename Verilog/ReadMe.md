### `axis_m` Module Operations:

1. **Data Buffering:**
   - `data_buf`: A register that buffers the input data (`data`) when the `send` signal is asserted. This buffered data is then used for transmission.

2. **Send Signal Delays:**
   - `send_pulse_1d` and `send_pulse_2d`: Registers that introduce delays to the `send` signal, ensuring proper synchronization with the clock.

3. **Handshake Signal (`handshake`):**
   - `handshake`: A wire that represents the handshake between the master and slave. It is asserted (`1`) when both `tready` and `tvalid` are high.

4. **Transmitted Data (`tdata`):**
   - `tdata`: Output data that is transmitted to the slave. It is driven by the buffered data (`data_buf`) when the `send_pulse_1d` signal is asserted.

5. **Validity Signal (`tvalid`):**
   - `tvalid`: Output signal indicating the validity of the transmitted data. It is asserted during the handshake.

6. **Last Data Signal (`tlast`):**
   - `tlast`: Output signal indicating the last data word in a sequence. It mirrors the `tvalid` signal.

7. **Finish Signal (`finish`):**
   - `finish`: Output signal indicating the completion of the transaction. It is asserted when the handshake occurs.

### `axis_s` Module Operations:

1. **Handshake Signal (`handshake`):**
   - `handshake`: A wire representing the handshake between the master and slave. It is asserted when both `tvalid` and `tready` are high.

2. **Ready Signal (`tready`):**
   - `tready`: Output signal indicating the slave's readiness to accept data. It is controlled by the `ready` input and is de-asserted during the handshake.

3. **Received Data (`data`):**
   - `data`: Output data from the slave. It is updated with the received data (`tdata`) during the handshake.

4. **Finish Signal (`finish`):**
   - `finish`: Output signal indicating the completion of the transaction. It is asserted when the handshake occurs and de-asserted when `ready` is enabled.
